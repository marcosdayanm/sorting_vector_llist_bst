# sorting_vector_llist_bst
In this project, I developed with C++ different ways to sort and store thousands of acceses to a server from different IP addresses and on different dates.
I made worked on 4 files, the first one to generate custom files to perform tests, and the others containg each implementation of the storage, sorting, and search of all acceses. The second file is implemented with a vector, the third one with a linked list, and the final one with a Binary Search Tree
